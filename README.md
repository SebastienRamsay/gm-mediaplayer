## Spawnable Entities

| Entity | Model |
|---|---|

All entities are available under the **Media Player** category in the spawn menu.

## Spatial Media Tool

The **Spatial Media Player** tool lets you attach audio sources to props. Players within the hear radius will receive the audio, which fades with distance.

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| Left click | Place a spatial source on a target. |
| Right click | Remove an existing spatial source. |
| Reload | Reopen the request UI for an existing source. |

To request media or control playback, look at the target object and hold **C** to open the sidebar.

The tool is available under **Media Player** in the tool menu.
